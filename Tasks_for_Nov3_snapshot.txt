# **Tasks for BioHackathon, Nov 3rd**

* Move github repo to collaborative bioinformatics (Ben)  
  * Clone it and push it back  
* make 15 fastas  with MAF \>= .05 (jedrzej)  
  * 3 populations   
  * 5 regions  
  * 200 sequences  
* test uclust (Kris)  
* test meshclust3.0 (Ben)  
* test mmseqs2 (Jedrzej)  
* compare results  (all)   
  * cluster quality  
  * \+ consistency across haploblocks  
  * \+ reasonably consistent numbers  
  * \+ may need to do alignments (later)  
  * \++ then construct genetic relatedness matrix \-- act as gold standard  
  * speed \-- calculate how long it will take to do this for 36,400 sequence sets  
* \#\#\#  
* examine interesting gene regions (optional)  
  * Make a few more haploblocks targeting interesting gene regions (Jedrzej)  
    * TNFa  
    * HLA  
* create hashes (tags)  
* Framework for individual hash mapping  
  * Quickly label (or count) those combinations that actually exist in individuals  
* Expand out to all European populations  
* Background haplotype overlap between populations  (Kris?)  
  * Define a criteria for merging clusters   
  * One possibility: calculate (euclidean?) distance between all clusters and merge those closest thogether based on some sort of similarity threshold   
  * How do you do this in a non relativistic way?  
* layer on disease related SNPs (for a few example diseases)  
  * ClinVar  
  * GWAS catalog  
  * PRS catalog (later)  
  * Which SNPs exist on which clusters  
  * How do you reflect that in hash structure  
*   
*   
*
